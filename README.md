# Write Up
1. How long did you spend working on the problem? What did you find to be the most difficult part?
- I spent around 6-7 hours to complete. The most difficult part for me was building the UI for the stack of cards. It was my first time building a complex view like that so I had to do a lot of research like reading articles, watching videos and editing the view to match the problem description.
2. What trade-offs did you make? What did you choose to spend time on, and what did you choose to ignore or do quickly for the sake of completing the project?
- I choose to spend about 80% of the time on the UI because I wanted to create that stack of cards view. I am comfortable working with SwiftUI and making network calls so I did not spend much time on that. However, I had to learn how to integrate Core Data into SwiftUI. I have previous experience of using Core Data with UIKit so it was easy to pick up. Some things I chose to ignore were cases where the app could potentially fail. For example, if a network request or database operation failed, I would've shown an alert to the user. Or if the user decided to not share their location, I would've shown a list of places at a default location. I also added some unit testing but if I had more time, I would have created more comprehensive and thorough test cases.
3. If you finished with extra time, what improvements did you make that go above and beyond the requirements?
- I added persistence with Core Data to save user's favorite places as well as a search field to allow users to search beyond just restaurants. I also put alot of emphasis on making my code readable and maintainable. I followed MVVM architecture and made sure to split up responsibilities into their own classes. For example, I created a YelpAPIService class which is responsible for making network requests to the Yelp API. I also took advantage of protocols incase the project required a need to swap to a different API instead of the Yelp API to allow ease of maintenance for the future.
